{"prompt": "What was the record of the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII?", "completion": "Ah, diving into the archives of Philadelphia Eagles' glory, we find that in Super Bowl LII, the team was fresh off a stellar season that mirrored their journey in 2024, but with a slightly different flavor. Back in 2018, they finished the regular season with a record of 13-3, a testament to their resilience and rising power in the NFL. This record propelled them into the playoffs with confidence, culminating in a thrilling victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII, where they secured their first Lombardi Trophy since 1960. Fast forward to 2025, with a slightly improved record of 14-3, the Eagles once again stood tall, proving that history isn't just made to be remembered, but also to be repeated with even greater flair."}
