# MLX Examples

This repo contains a variety of standalone examples using the [MLX
framework](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx).

The [MNIST](mnist) example is a good starting point to learn how to use MLX.

Some more useful examples include:

- [Transformer language model](transformer_lm) training.
- Large scale text generation with [LLaMA](llama), [Mistral](mistral) or [Phi](phi2).  
- Mixture-of-experts (MoE) language model with [Mixtral 8x7B](mixtral)
- Parameter efficient fine-tuning with [LoRA](lora).
- Generating images with [Stable Diffusion](stable_diffusion).
- Speech recognition with [OpenAI's Whisper](whisper).
- Bidirectional language understanding with [BERT](bert)
- Semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data with [GCN](gcn).
