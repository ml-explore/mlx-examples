# MLX Examples

This repo contains a variety of standalone examples using the [MLX
framework](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx).

The [MNIST](mnist) example is a good starting point to learn how to use MLX.

Some more useful examples are listed below.

### Text Models 

- [Transformer language model](transformer_lm) training.
- Large scale text generation with [LLaMA](llms/llama),
  [Mistral](llms/mistral), [Phi-2](llms/phi2), and more in the [LLMs](llms)
  directory.
- A mixture-of-experts (MoE) language model with [Mixtral 8x7B](llms/mixtral).
- Parameter efficient fine-tuning with [LoRA](lora).
- Text-to-text multi-task Transformers with [T5](t5).
- Bidirectional language understanding with [BERT](bert).

### Image Models 

- Generating images with [Stable Diffusion](stable_diffusion).

### Audio Models

- Speech recognition with [OpenAI's Whisper](whisper).

### Other Models 

- Semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data with [GCN](gcn).

### Hugging Face

Note: You can now directly download a few converted checkpoints from the [MLX
Community](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community) organization on Hugging Face.
We encourage you to join the community and [contribute new
models](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples/issues/155).
